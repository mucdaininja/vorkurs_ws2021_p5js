# vorkurs_ws2021_p5js
Tiny paint program we made during the p5 course :)

## HowTo

Copy the content of [paint.js](https://github.com/mucdaininja/vorkurs_ws2021_p5js/blob/main/paint.js)
into the [p5 online-editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and click run :)

Or just visit the saved program hosted on p5js.org directly [here](https://editor.p5js.org/mucdai/sketches/EY1Hp6Lwi)

## Hack it

Feel free to play around with it! The only way to learn a programming language is to write programs in it!
Someone important said this and I found it to be true. Even if you don't understand *everything* just
have fun and explore. Programming is largely about curiosity!

Don't forget to use the [p5 documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/). Modify the spray-brush (eg. remove 
the circles' outline), play around with the random values etc.

## Share it

Want to share your own version of the paint-app? Send me a link to your p5js project or GitHub repo via eMail (or Slack for the
MUC.DAI folks) and I'll be happy to link it here :)

Take care and enjoy your studies. The Ninja.
