# vorkurs_ws2021_p5js
Tiny paint program we made during the p5 course :)

## HowTo

Copy the content of [paint.js](https://github.com/mucdaininja/vorkurs_ws2021_p5js/blob/main/paint.js)
into the [p5 online-editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and click run :)

Or just visit the saved program hosted on p5js.org directly [here](https://editor.p5js.org/mucdai/sketches/EY1Hp6Lwi)

Take care. The Ninja.
